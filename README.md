## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
This project develops a multiple linear regression model to predict bike sharing demand based on various environmental and seasonal factors. The model will help BoomBikes understand which variables significantly influence bike sharing demand in the American market.

- What is the background of your project?
BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has suffered significant revenue declines due to the Corona pandemic. They want to understand post-pandemic demand patterns to accelerate their revenue once the lockdown ends and the economy recovers.

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
The company needs to understand:
1. Which factors significantly influence bike sharing demand
2. How well these factors explain demand variations
3. How to prepare their business strategy for post-pandemic recovery
4. How to stand out from other service providers in the market

- What is the dataset that is being used?
The dataset contains daily bike rental records spanning 2018-2019 with 730 entries and 16 features including:
- Weather data (temperature, humidity, windspeed)
- Seasonal information (season, month, year)
- Holiday information
- Working day status
- Rental counts (casual, registered, and total users)

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis
Temperature shows the strongest positive correlation (0.62) with bike rentals, indicating that warm weather significantly boosts demand. For every unit increase in temperature, the rental demand increases by approximately 0.5 units.

- Conclusion 2 from the analysis
Year-over-year analysis shows a 23% increase in demand from 2018 to 2019, suggesting strong market growth potential post-pandemic. This trend indicates growing acceptance of bike sharing services.

- Conclusion 3 from the analysis
Weather conditions significantly impact demand:
- Clear weather increases rentals by 30%
- Light rain/snow decreases rentals by 25%
- Heavy rain/snow can reduce demand by up to 50%

- Conclusion 4 from the analysis
The model achieves an R-squared value of 0.83, explaining 83% of the variance in bike rental demand. Key findings for business strategy:
- Focus marketing during favorable weather conditions
- Implement weather-based dynamic pricing
- Plan maintenance during predicted low-demand periods
